### 🙏 Acknowledgements

This portfolio is originally based on the work by [Soumyajit4419](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio), but rewritten entirely in TypeScript along with other changes.
I've customized and extended it to better suit my own style and goals. Many thanks for the great foundation!
